Paragraph:
If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
Decomposed:
Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
Equations:
raymond_laundry = sarah_laundry / 2
sarah_laundry = 4 * david_laundry
sarah_laundry = 400

Paragraph:
A total of $9000 is invested, part of it at 10% and the rest at 12%. The total interest after one year is $1030.
Decomposed:
A total of $9000 is invested.
Part of it at 10%.
The rest at 12%.
The total interest after one year is $1030.
Equations:
total_money = 9000
total_money = 10_part + 12_part
0.1 * 10_part + 0.12 * 12_part = 1030

Paragraph:
Mike decides he wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions.  He has 600 movies.  A third of the movies are in various series and he knows he can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together.  40% of the remaining movies are older movies which are $5.  A normal movie costs $10.
Decomposed:
Mike has 600 movies.
A third of the movies are in various series.
He can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie.
40% of the remaining movies are older movies which are $5.
A normal movie costs $10.
Equations:
total_movies = 600
series_movies = total_movies / 3
series_cost_each = 6
older_movies = (total_movies - series_movies) * 0.4
older_cost_each = 5
normal_cost_each = 10

Paragraph:
James decides to buy birthday candles for his 2 sons. One of them is 12 and the other is 4 years younger. A pack of 5 candles costs $3.
Decomposed:
James has 2 sons.
One of them is 12.
The other is 4 years younger.
A pack of 5 candles costs $3.
Equations:
son1_age = 12
son2_age = son1_age - 4
cost_per_candle = 3 / 5

Bob is left with 13 apples.
Equations:
(bob_apples + 3) / 2 = 13
